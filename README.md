Shortest-Path
=============

(Python) shortest path

shortpath.py allows the user to:

 1.  Create a graph
 2.  Find the shortest path between vertices on a graph.

QtPath.py requires the pyqt library. 
 Creates a graph with 400 vertices represented by a 10x40 table with vertices labeled a1-j40.
 All edges are weighted at 1. A begining and end vertex are entered and the script finds the shortest path 
 between them. The table is then updated to reflect those vertices are no longer available.
 
QtPath.py can be called from shortpath.py if they are in the same directory.
