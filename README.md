Shortest-Path
=============

(Python) Dijkstra's shortest path

Shortpath.py allows the user to:

1.  Create a graph
2.  Edit a large graph based on a 10x64 breadboard
3.  Find the shortest path between vertices on a graph

QTpath.py creates graph with 400 vertices represented by a 10x40 table with vertices labeled a1-j40.
All edges weighted at 1. A begining and end vertex are entered and the script finds the shortest path 
between them. The table is then updated to reflect those vertices are no longer available.
